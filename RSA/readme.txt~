##Files:

Makefile
codonDecrypt.cc
codonEncrypt.cc
encrypt.cc
decrypt.cc
keyGen.cc
numberTheory.cc
numberTheory.h
transform.cc
transform.h

##I have made rules in the make file so that the only compiling that
needs to be done is: 

make all

Then you can use:

make clean 

to clean all unnecessary files.
----------------------------------------------
##cmd argumemts:

>>./keyGen {Prime1} {Prime2}
>>./encrypt private.txt {fileToBeEncypted} {encryptedFile}
>>./decrypt public.txt {fileToBeDecypted} {decryptedFile}

In the end  {fileToBeEncypted}=={decryptedFile}
-------------------------------------------------------------------
for CODONS:

>>./keyGen {Prime1} {Prime2}
>>./codonEncrypt private.txt {fileToBeEncypted} {encryptedFile}
>>./codonDecrypt public.txt {fileToBeDecypted} {decryptedFile}

In the end  {fileToBeEncypted}=={decryptedFile}
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
##BUGS!
#My is prime gives funny answer when 0 is mixed with large
  integer. It shows 0 to be a non prime but when you input large
  number with keyGen example

>> ./keyGen (aLargePrimeNumber) 0

will give me floating point exception error.It works fine with other
numbers.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Sometimes my Codons act funny. They act fine i.e encrypt and decrypt
 both give me correct answer but sometimes decrypt was unable to
 get some of the alphabets back(in one test, 3 chars in of a paragraph werent
 decrpted properly).I think there is some issue with my
 codonEncrypt.cc as I get a wierd character after every trplet of
 digits.
