This project has one program in skipliststimes.cc. It reports the average insertion time in a SkipList as the list grows larger. It takes two command line arguments: batchSize, the number of insertions to perform at a time, and numBatches, the number of batches to insert. The program  creates new SkipList<long long, int> Array and inserts increasing keys batchSize at a time for numBatches times. Then it prints to the terminal the size of the list when the batch began, followed by the average insertion time for the batch i.e time it took to insert the
whole batch divided by the number of insertions in the batch. 

To compile:

>> make skiplisttiming

To access:

>>./skiplisttiming batchSize numBatch

---------------------------------------------------------

Known issues:

 THe graph that I made was with batchSize 100000 and numBatch 100. MY processor couldnt handle batchSize more than 100000 or else I would have had a better understanding if the size was bigger.


-------------------------------------------------------------
 Analysis:

 The insertions look pretty logarthmic. This attributes to O(log[n]) efficiency of insertions in skipLists.
