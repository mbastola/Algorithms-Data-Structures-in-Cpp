This project contains 3 programs. The first one is

matrixtest.cc

This program tests the given matrix created by the readGraph function by taking in a input file that has necessary info about the graph and prints the adj matrix to the terminal.

To compile:

>> make matrixtest

To run:

>> ./matrixtest filein 

--------------------------------------------------------------------

listtest.cc

This program tests the given adj list created bu readGraph function by taking in a input file that has necessary info about the graph and prints the adj list, the corresponding weight list and the lenght list to the terminal.

To compile:

>> make listtest

To run:

>> ./listtest filein 

--------------------------------------------------------------------

mst.cc

This is the main program that checks the minimum spanning tree created by the prims implementation for 1)adj matrix and 2) adj graph.

if the number commandline argument is 4 where the 4th argument is 'l' the main function implements prims algorithm for list else, matrix.

It takes other two parameters from command prompt, filein and fileout.
 
It reads the graph from filein and prints the minimum distace to temrinal while the minimum spanning edge to the fileout

To compile:

>> make mst

to run:

>>./mst filein fileout (l)   #l is optional

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Possible Errors:

So far it looks okay.
